//Hello, the purpose of this code is to make a Book structure that acts like a library. The books in the library can be manipulated by the user.
//Step by Step:
//1. First i made a menu for the user to navigate through. It welcomes the user to the library and asks them what they want to do
//2. I created a view method. This method is used in all other methods. the view mehtod checks if a book exists based on the ISBN
//and returns the index if it does, and -1 otherwise.
//3. I made a addBook method. This method asks the user to enter a ISBN, if it exists, then it asks the quantity of books the user ones to add.
//If it doesnt exists, it asks the user to enter all fields of the Book struct
//4. I made a removeBook method. This method asks the user to enter a ISBN, if it exists, hte book is removed. Otherwise it tells the user the book does not exist
//5. I made an updateBook method. This method allows the user to change any feature to the book. They enter the change if they want one and -1 if they dont want to change that field.
//6. I maed a viewBook method. This method diplasy all information abot the book, based on the ISBN entered by the user. tells the user if the book doesnt exist
//7. I made a loadBooks method. This method imports all books from library.txt into a Book array. It is done at the start of the code.
//8. I made a saveBooks method. This method saves any changes to books and adds any books to library.txt based on changes made by the user.
//9. The user can make as many changed they want in the menu until theyselect exit, which ends the code.
